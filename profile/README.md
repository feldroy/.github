# Feldroy

Hi there! We are Feldroy, the indie research lab run by Daniel and Audrey Roy Greenfeld. We are currently experimenting with combining bleeding edge web development ideas and AI, rethinking the future of web development. 

Your support allows us to share all our work with the community as open source software (OSS).
